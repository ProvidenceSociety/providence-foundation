  <p>
    For over twenty years, faithful teachers in Nicaragua have poured their lives
    into educating the next generation, often with little to no financial incentive.
    Many have lived in rented or substandard housing, with no way to save toward a
    home of their own. Their sacrifice has given students the chance to dream,
    but their own futures remain insecure.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our Houses for Teachers initiative seeks to honor these servants of God by
    providing <strong>safe, dignified, and permanent housing</strong>. This project
    will cover land acquisition and construction costs, creating a sustainable
    community where teachers can flourish alongside their families.
  </p>
  <p>
    A teacher’s home is more than shelter—it is a visible testimony that the labor
    of teaching is valued in the Kingdom of God.
