  <p>
    We have entered what historians call the <strong>5th century of American education</strong>.
    Despite unprecedented technological advancement, illiteracy rates are rising and our
    educational system is drifting further from the Godly, classical foundations that once
    set it apart.

    This initiative calls for a <em>rediscovery of what truly makes education flourish</em>:
    a union of religion, morality, and knowledge that shapes citizens who can govern
    themselves and bless their communities.
