  <p>
    Teachers are at the heart of education. Yet too often, they are crushed under
    administrative burdens, endless grading, and fragmented resources. Our Teacher
    Formation & Time Redemption initiative seeks to <strong>free teachers from
    busywork</strong> so they can focus on their true calling: <em>forming students
    in truth, virtue, and wisdom</em>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Through workshops, micro-grants, and carefully designed tools, we help teachers
    reclaim planning time, deepen pedagogy, and be refreshed in their vocation.
    This project equips them not only with methods but with spiritual encouragement
    to endure in the good work of teaching.
  </p>
  <p>
    Your support provides training sessions, curated resources, and practical
    automations that multiply the time teachers have to invest directly in students.
